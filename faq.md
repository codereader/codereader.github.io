		  <td colspan="2"><p class="highlighted"><strong>Q: </strong>Can DarkRadiant be used for <strong>The Dark Mod </strong>maps only?</p>
			  <p>A: No, it can be used for general Doom 3 mapping as well.</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p class="highlighted"><strong>Q: </strong> Can DarkRadiant be used on Linux  too? </p>
			  <p>A: Yes, of course. DarkRadiant is developed with both platforms in mind and runs perfectly on Linux and Windows. (OrbWeaver is developing on Linux, whereas greebo is working mainly on Windows.) 
			  There is a .deb package available for <a href="download.php">download</a>. </p>

			  <p class="highlighted"><strong>Q: </strong>Can DarkRadiant be used for Half-Life, Quake 3, or other games as well (apart from Doom 3)? </p>
			  <p>A: No. DarkRadiant has been specialised for the Doom 3 engine only (and the Dark Mod). It's possible to use it for other Doom 3 modifications though, it's usually enough to specify the <strong>fs_game</strong> setting in the preferences. Quake 4 Editing should be possible, but it's not tested towards that game. </p>

		  <p class="highlighted"><strong>Q: </strong>What's that <strong>Dark Mod</strong> thingy you're talking about?  </p>
		  <p>A: See our website: <a href="http://www.thedarkmod.com/" target="_blank">http://www.thedarkmod.com/</a>. I may cite: <em>&quot;The Dark Mod is a FREE, first-person stealth game inspired by the original Thief series by Looking Glass Studios. In it you play a hooded figure slinking through the shadows of a gothic steampunk city, hunting priceless valuables while avoiding the swords and arrows of those hired to stop you. The Dark Mod was originally released Oct. 17th, 2009. The standalone version, TDM 2.0, launched in Oct. 2013. &quot;</em> </p>
		  <p>DarkRadiant is part of The Dark Mod project with the goal of providing the fan-mission community an easy-to-use editor. </p>

		  <p class="highlighted"><strong>Q: </strong>I'm a coder and would like to help!</p>		  
		  <p> If you've got C++ coding skills and are interested in getting involved in the development process, please visit the Dark Mod Forums and drop a note in the <a href="http://forums.thedarkmod.com/forum/11-i-want-to-help/" target="_blank">&quot;I want to help&quot;</a> forum.</p>
		  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <p class="highlighted"><strong>Q: </strong>I've got <strong>no </strong>coding skills but still would like to help!</p>
		  <p>Ok, fetch a good book about C++ or work through one of the many C++ tutorials on the web. This certainly won't be enough to immediately start coding in DarkRadiant, but if you're determined enough and have willingness and ability to learn and improve yourself, feel free to post a note in the Dark Mod Forums to try your luck at a beginner task we might give you. We certainly can't hold your hand while learning to code, but we can support you.</p>

		  <p class="highlighted"><strong>Q: </strong>Does DarkRadiant run in Windows XP?</p>
		  <p>Since DarkRadiant 1.8.1 the support for the Windows XP target has been dropped. The last version supporting Windows XP is DarkRadiant 1.8.0 which can be obtained in the download section.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <p class="highlighted"><strong>Q: </strong>The renderviews are white/blank after starting up! </p>
		  <p>This frequently happens to nvidia users, caused by the &quot;Threaded Optimization&quot; setting in the nvidia control panel. To fix this, open the nvidia control panel, head to &quot;3D Settings&quot; and switch off the &quot;Threaded Optimization&quot; setting for DarkRadiant.exe. You don't need to switch it off for all your other games, a setting for the DarkRadiant.exe file should do the trick.</p>
